# Challenge-7-Polar-Coordinate

Introduction (app) to polar coordinates: https://www.geogebra.org/m/guCcvwFP

Objectives for this challenge:

With your preferred programming language/framework/engine (C++, C#, Python), “hard-code” a function that converts 3D polar coordinates (for both Spherical and Cylindrical cases) to Cartesian coordinates.

Create 3 sliders to control the parameters of the polar coordinates.

Create an object in the scene. Use the three sliders as input of the function to position the object accordingly.

Please submit commented code and a short video of the visual result.
